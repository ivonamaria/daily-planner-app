# Work Day Scheduler

I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I have used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
